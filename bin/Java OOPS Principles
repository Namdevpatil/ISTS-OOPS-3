1. Encapsulation: Wrapping the fields(variables) and methods into one unit.

best example is a class.

2. Inheritance: Reusing the properties from super/base/parent class to sub/derived/child class.

Task: make a document on types of inheritance(we have 5 inheritance types) with examples.

3. Polymorphism: one entity in many forms.

	=> static/compile time polymorphism: we can implement this type of polymorphism with,
		1. constructor overloading:
		2. method overloading
		
	=> dynamic/run time polymorphism: we can implement this type of polymorphism with,
		1. method overriding

4. Abstraction
